# CalmMe
Introduction:

 CalmMe is an innovative tool that leverages artificial intelligence to offer emotional support and
 guidance for individuals seeking to improve their mental well-being.
 These virtual assistants are designed to provide users with a safe, non-judgmental space to express their
 feelings, helping them manage stress, anxiety, and other emotional challenges.
 By engaging in conversation with the chatbot, users can receive personalized self-care tips, stress-relief
 techniques, and coping strategies tailored to their unique needs.
 While not a replacement for professional therapy, mental health chatbots serve as accessible resources for
 those looking to enhance their emotional resilience and maintain mental health in their daily lives.

 TECHNOLOGIES USED
 
 i. LangChain_groq: this library provides tools for integrating Groq, a declarative query language for JSON, with LangChain
 framework for building large language model (LLM) applications. It allows users to interact with Groq databases and use
 Groq queries within LangChain workflows.
 
 ii. Langchain.embeddings: This module uses pre-trained models to generate embeddings (numerical representations of text). Embeddings are crucial for tasks like semantic search and text similarity comparison...
 
 iii. Langchain.document_loaders: This module deals with loading documents from various sources into LangChain for
 further processing.
 
 iv. Langchain. vector stores: This module is dedicated to storing and managing document embeddings for efficient retrieval.
 Vector databases are optimized for handling large-scale text data.
 
 v. Langchain.chains: This module focuses on assembling chains of actions to perform complex tasks, often involving LLMs,
 such as question answering and text generation.
 
 vi. Langchain.prompts: This module is essential for designing and managing prompts for interacting with LLMs. Effective
 prompts are crucial for eliciting desired outputs from LLMs.
 
 vii. langchain.text_splitter: This module divides large text documents into smaller, manageable chunks,
 often required for efficient processing by LLMs and vector databases.
 
 viii. ChromeDB: This library provides an in-memory and persistent vector database designed to manage and query vector
 embeddings, facilitating efficient similarity search and information retrieval.
 
 ix. Gradio: This library allows you to create user interfaces for machine learning models, enabling users to easily interact
 with and test your models through web-based interfaces without complex code. It simplifies deployment and demo creation.
